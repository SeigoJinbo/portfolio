<div class="about-text">
  <p>I’m Seigo. I grew up in Portland, Oregon where I worked as a data analyst to
    fund my hobby as a musician. I moved to Tokyo in 2017 to study Japanese and get in touch with my roots.</p>
  <p>In 2020 I enrolled in full-time coding bootcamp at Le Wagon where I learned everything from databases,
    product design, UI/UX, and everything that goes into developing web applications. </p>
  <p> Now I’m seeking new projects to further expand my knowledge and skills.</p>
